Here are numerous group projects I have been involved in during the academic year 2023-2024: 

### Kelp segmentation page 
As part of the Computer Vision class I took in Spring 2024, my team and I work on an algorithm to detect Kelp Canopy in the ...
Refer to the [webpage](https://nadira30.github.io/kelp_segmentation/) for more information. 

### Fake news detection page 
As part of the Machine Learning Algorithm, I took in the Spring 2024 term, my team and I worked on developping two supervised and one unsupervised learning algorithm capable of detection fake news. 
Refer to the following [webpage](https://nadira30.github.io/7641-Group-Project/) for more information. 

### Senior design page
As part of my undergraduate senior design project, my team and I participated in the National Robotics Challenge and the Arkansas Space Grant Consortium project. 
We design an automous ground vehicle capacle of navigating 4 main points using a convolution neural network and the Donkey Car open source API. 
My main task was to work on improving and training the neural network for better results and design and update the web page.
