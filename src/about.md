A bit more...
-------------
My area of interest has always been related to intelligent systems. Particularly how they can be integrated in smart homes and heathcare to improve people‚Äôs daily lives in their environment. 

I am currently a student researcher in the [RAIL lab](https://rail.gatech.edu/)  under Dr. Sonia Chernova where I investigate smart medication systems for older adults with Mild cognitive Impairment living in smart homes. our main goal for this research is for intelligent systems (Robots and conversatonal agents) to be able to determine the right/opportune timing to initiate conversation or tell the older adult to take their medication. 

I am currently a member of the Robotics Graduate Student Organization(RoboGrads) and the African Graduate Students Connect (AGSC) at Georgia Tech. 
Previously I have been: 
* Treasurer of the Rovbotics Club at the University of Central Arkansas (UCA)
* Vice President of the Girls Who Code Loop at UCA
* President of the Society of Physics student at UCA
* President of the National Society of Collegiate Student at UCA

My hobbies are part of me and keep me grounded, active, and motivated. I am an outdoor person therefore love to hike, run to connect with mother nature. I used to play Basket ball and still pratice when I get time or connects with basketball enthousiasts. My nomadic self always enjoy a great vacation where I get to discover new culture, discover the rich cuisine and understand human kind.
